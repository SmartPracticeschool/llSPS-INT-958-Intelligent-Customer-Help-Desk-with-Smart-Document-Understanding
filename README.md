# 1. PROJECT SUMMARY :
As we know ,  a product needs a help desk so that it will help us when we are stuck in using any of the functions of the product. So this is  a project which will help the customer to use the products easily without going wrong. So, the project is all about creating a chatbot using watson assistant with discovery and cloud functions which will behave as a help desk for the customer answering the queries. The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.
In this project, there will be another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” we can return relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve our customers’ problems.
To take it a step further, the project shall use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries. All the flows will be added in the node red and deployed.
